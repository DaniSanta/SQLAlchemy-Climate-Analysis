## Precipitation Analysis
1. Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.
2. Select only the date and prcp values.
3. Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.
4. Sort the DataFrame values by date.
5. Plot the results using the DataFrame plot method.
6. Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

## Station Analysis
1. Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.
2. Design a query to find the most active stations.
3. List the stations and observation counts in descending order.
4. Which station has the highest number of observations?
5. Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).
6. Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.
7. Plot the results as a histogram with bins=12.

*Hint: You may need to use functions such as func.min, func.max, func.avg, and func.count in your queries.
